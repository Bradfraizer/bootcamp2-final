                  <p><strong>Hello, World!</strong></p>
                  <p>  Welcome to my page.  My name is <strong>Bradley Fraizer</strong> and this is my first <strong>Web Development Portfolio</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My life has taken me in many different directions over the course of twenty eigth years and never would've imagined myself where I am now.  Most of my life
                    I was known for my achievements across several different sports.  My family and I always assumed that by the time I had reached the age I currently
                    am that I would be professionally in one of the several sports that I excelled at.  In fact, I would've bet everything I had on it, but life had different
                    plans...  <br>
                    <br>
                    When I was fifteen, all of that came crashing down on my head with one, the first of many, emergency trips to the hospital.  After a lot of
                    head scratching, guessing, and even more testing done by the doctors, they had discovered a rare anomaly with my blood that effectively ended my career
                    in any of those fields I had devoted my life to before they truly took off.  The complexity and severity of things, along with new discoveries found by various
                    specialists, and the intervention required countless times had left me weak, depressed, and in overwhelming pain for the eleven years that followed.  During those eleven years, I had brief
                    glimpses of my health improving and was able to go out and do what I considered "normal activity" and get a job.  Due to the fickle nature of my illness, I
                    could never hold onto a job for more than a few months before the revolving door opened again and I was forced back into it.  I was incredibly lost and dripping
                    with anxiety over how I was supposed to make a living moving forward in life with all of my highly honed skills no longer holding any relevance in my future.
                    My life now requires unique parameters that most employers can't work around or aren't willing to.  Let's be honest, it is also very hard to explain such little
                    professional work experience or large gaps in employment on a resume also.  So, what hope did I have when my present and future realities were in ruins?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On October 22nd, 2016, I started feeling optimistic again. My family and I had flown to Cleveland to speak with the most accredited specialist in the world on my
                    particular cocktail of ailments.  We had originally discussed an extremely invasive surgery, which seemed like my last option.  He was surprised to hear that
                    even though I had seen countless doctors and had around ten separate specialists perform surgery on me that none of them had even suggested a non-invasive alternative.
                    His simple recommendation changed my life and helped me avoid a surgery that I most likely never would've came out of.  Shortly after my health began to drastically improve
                    and was re-envigorated with the feeling of hope for the first time in a many years.  Even though I was healthier, I still have to abide by those guidelines that govern my life, but at least
                    I could start picking up my life, piece by piece.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A few months later, a close friend of mine offered me a job at one of the several Vapor Longue businesses he had
                    started over the past few years. I'm proud to say that I was healthy enough to hold onto that job for nearly two years, until the business went under.  Fortunately, during my time working at a vape shop
                    I was able to meet and become friends with people who have found a home in the tech field.  I had little experience and no previous passion for computers, but saw it as career opportunity
                    that would fit perfectly into my tumultuous life.  After countless discussions on the subject, and some encouragement, I signed up for my first Web Development course at <strong>Bitwise</strong>.
                    Three months ago, if you would've engaged me in a conversation about computers, tech, or web development I would've promptly found a way to exit
                    the conversation due to my overall unfimiliarity with the subject.  After my first six week course, I felt exactly what my friends had been talking about.  I had found a home; a place to begin
                    a future.  With every passing week, I find myself gaining more and more passion for this field as my knowledge expands.  I wholeheartedly desire to continue learning so that I can reach success as a developer.
                    My newly discovered <strong>dream job</strong> would be programming or designing video games, but I want to be as multifaceted as possible and keep my options open while I continue the process of learning because I could find a passion
                    that accentuates my skillset in other programming and development fields.
